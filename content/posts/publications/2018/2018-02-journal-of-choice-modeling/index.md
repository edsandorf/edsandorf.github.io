When analyzing discrete choice data we assume that respondents compare alternatives and make a utility maximizing choice. The majority of DCEs use a matrix display with one row per attribute
and one column per alternative. A comparison by alternatives implies that respondents process the
choice task column-by-column. However, evidence from psychology and judgment and decision
making research suggest that learned reading patterns dominate and as such the standard matrix
display might induce processing by attributes rather than alternatives. We test this using a split
sample survey conducted in France where respondents were randomly allocated into a standard or
transposed matrix display group. Our results show that there is no difference in relative scale
between the two groups, but that elicited preferences differ. Importantly, ASCs are insignificant in
the transposed condition. We find no difference in propensity to use simplifying strategies, but
respondents in the standard display condition are more likely to choose according to a random
regret minimization (RRM) model rather than random utility model (RUM). We discuss the implications
of our findings for future discrete choice experiments.
