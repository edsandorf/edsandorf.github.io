Using a discrete choice experiment, we invited participants to make a series of choices between policy scenarios aimed at relaxing the lockdown, which were specified not in terms of their nature (e.g. whether or not to allow schools to re-open) but in terms of their effects along seven dimensions.</description></item><item><title>New publication in Environmental and Resource Economics</title><link>https://edsandorf.me/posts/publications/2020/2020-08-environmental-and-resource-economics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://edsandorf.me/posts/publications/2020/2020-08-environmental-and-resource-economics/</guid><description>The growth in global aquaculture production may address the lack of sustainability in wild fisheries, alleviate poverty in rural and coastal areas, and help meet the worldwide increase in demand for animal protein. However, there is an ongoing debate about the severity of the environmental impact of aquaculture production. Investing in new high-tech production systems can address both productivity growth and the environmental externalities, but high investment costs hinder adoption of high-tech production methods.</description></item><item><title>New publication in Resource and Energy Economics</title><link>https://edsandorf.me/posts/publications/2020/2020-05-resource-and-energy-economics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://edsandorf.me/posts/publications/2020/2020-05-resource-and-energy-economics/</guid><description>Internet panels are increasingly used for stated preference research. Because members of such panels receive compensation for each completed survey, one concern is that over time this creates professional respondents who answer surveys solely for the monetary compensation. We identify professional respondents using data on panel tenure, survey response frequency, completion rate and total number of completed surveys. We find evidence of two types of professional respondents: “hyperactives” who answer surveys frequently and “experienced” who have long panel tenure and a large number of completed surveys.</description></item></channel></rss>
